## Trigger:
- A) use arguments.
- - E.g. `python main.py --fortnight` would tell the script its been a fortnight since last activation
- B) Use Date/Time.
- - Keep a record of when last checked & when last thing was. (keep record for each `week`, `fortnight`, `month`, `bi-month`, `year` passed.)
- C) Use schedular
- - File must be run ALL the time, and tasks scheduled using schedule module

## GUI / CLI:
- Have a GUI / CLI for creating "syncs"
- - Would allow you to give a file / directory and a cloud location to save/backup to.
